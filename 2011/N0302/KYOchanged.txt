====make_root_tof.cc====

-source for making the rootfile "roo.root" from "data.txt"
-f1, tr 1, branch 3 : layer, energy, time

===================



====draw_hist_tof.cc====

- source for making histogram "count vs time" from "roo.root"
- fitting histogram with gaussian function with subranges
- I saved the graph as "histogram1.ps"
- I saved the graph as "histogram2.ps" with gaussian fitting.
  (narrow ranges)

- calculate and print tof, gapt, v, c, gamma, restE, totE, kinE
  to get "rel. kinetic energy" (which is our final goal).

==================



====gauss.cc====

- a direct way to make and fit  gaussian function (from 10comphy).
- NOT USED in this directory!!

====================
